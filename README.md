# MmKit
MmKit is an example of how you could conceal a file from user view but still be able to run it. You must
realise this is only an **example** and is not meant to be used without modification.

It works by taking a file and loading it into the driver's memory space, and when `RunHiddenFile()` function is called,
it will run the file from memory.
